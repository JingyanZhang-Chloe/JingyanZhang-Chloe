My name is Jingyan (Chloe) Zhang, and I am currently a student at Ã‰cole Polytechnique, pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Economics with a minor in Computer Science.
My academic focus is heavily on advanced mathematics, including linear algebra, analysis, calculus, probability, and statistics.
I have a solid foundation in programming with Python, C, and C++, as well as SQL, R, and Stata.
I am particularly interested in applying rigorous mathematical methods to financial modeling, quant finance, and risk management
